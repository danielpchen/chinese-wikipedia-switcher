Chinese Wikipedia Switcher
==========================

This Google Chrome extension automatically redirects your guest visits at Chinese Wikipedia to your preferred version.

Currently, the Chinese-language Wikipedia does not redirect guest visits to one of its converted versions (PRC / HK / Macau / Malaysia & Singapore / Taiwan) based on user IP or browser language. Guest users who manually selects a converted version is reverted to the unconverted version when clicking internal links, causing reading troubles. This extension reroutes guest visits to the converted version selected by the user in the extension's Options page.

INSTALLATION

For non-Windows users, you may download the packaged .crx file to install the extension. For Windows users, since the stable version of Chrome disables extensions not listed on Chrome Web Store, you basically have three options: 1) switch to the Dev channel; 2) install the extension on Chrome Canary; 3) download the extension's separate files into a directory on your local disk and load the unpacked extension at that directory. 

** I would've been more than willing to uploaded the extension to Chrome Web Store if Google did not require a 5-dollar registration fee.
