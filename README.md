Chinese Wikipedia Switcher
==========================

This Google Chrome extension automatically redirects your guest visits at Chinese Wikipedia to your preferred version.

Currently, the Chinese-language Wikipedia does not redirect guest visits to one of its converted versions (PRC / HK / Macau / Malaysia & Singapore / Taiwan) based on user IP or browser language. Guest users who manually selects a converted version is reverted to the unconverted version when clicking internal links, causing reading troubles. This extension reroutes guest visits to the converted version selected by the user in the extension's Options page.
